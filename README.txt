AI Report:

I used ChatGPT to help me with this assignment, using my tokens sparingly.

AI helped mainly with texture handling, with the texture = null for the zero argument constructor.
I kept the zero argument constructor in there despite your email to the class, with the if loop for null,
loading a texture for the zero argument ped.

I also had AI set up the text drawing as a last minute addition, for the isRushing bool being true or false, 
for both peds though even though they're in sync.

AI is useful for saving time and debugging, it can check issues you present to it and provide a reason and solution.
A drawback to using AI is that in general, it can present methods of doing things that are more advanced than my skill level. 
I'm mostly just trying to follow along with what you've provided us in class, for example the PlantsVsZombies repository that I cloned, 
and I want to actually understand what it is I'm coding.

AI Report:

I used the free limited ChatGPT credits to handle some things throughout the project.
I tried to mirror what you provided us in projects like your PlantsVsZombies one and
what I had done in my A2 Part 2, which this assignment was continued from, but I had
some more ideas I wanted to implement but wasn't exactly sure how to handle, or sometimes
in general they may be too niche for Stack Overflow to provide effective info on.

I prompted the LLM to handle the lane logic, including spawning the cars in with checking for
overlaps/collisions amongst the sprites. I also had it give me code for pixel-perfect collision
detection logic for the player pedestrian's hitbox. I also had the idea to add a slight game freeze
upon the player being struck by a vehicle for pacing purposes, so I had it handle that.

AI was generally helpful with getting things working but sometimes it will provide a bunch of code,
and after implementing it, nothing changed. I wanted a delay to the game freeze similar to an alarm
in something like GameMaker code, but it ended up just being cumbersome.

The music was made by me entirely from samples I bought licenses for.

Thanks Aaron, thank you for two great courses. I don't think I have you for any more courses but
I hope to stay in contact/see you around as much as I can through a computer screen.

Have a good one :)
